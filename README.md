## Introduction
Every time I'm learning a new technology or a new language, I feel the need to create a reproducible template project that has already the basics built in. The idea is to have a somewhat abstracted away template, such that I
can in the future use it as a basis for an actual project without having to remember fine details and commands to the specific tech stack at hand.

Since that was becoming a strong habit and there were numerous little template projects littered throughout my profile, I took the liberty to unify them under a single repository. They hopefully have the basics covered, as in a language
it should have compiling, running, testing and debugging as targets or at least documentation on how to perform these actions for the given template.
